# Topic - BuiltIn Type
what builtint type c++ define?
[cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types)
what is character set? what character set there are? what decide the width of character the machine supported?
what is extended character set?
int as long as short, long as long as int, long long as long as long. ??? but they are never same longth on any OS/platform?

smallest chunk of addressable memory - byte
basic unit of storage - word
how to define basic unit of storage?

char(signed or unsigned decided by compiler), why? isn't it redundant?

how range divided evenly to -127 to 127?

what type to use? how to decide?

what decide the size of a type? machine? compiler? C++ language? what role these three play?
